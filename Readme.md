## Homework 1:
Download the [20 Newsgroups dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/20news-18828.tar.gz),
then do such tasks:
* Preprocess this text dataset, and get the VSM representation of each document.
* Implement a KNN classifier, and test its performance in the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

Homework 1 was completed on November 2.

I submitted [a lab report](https://github.com/openx2/201814806ChenXin/blob/master/Homework1/lab%20report.pdf) with more details.

## Homework 2:
Use the 20 Newsgroups dataset and do the task:
* Implement the Naive Bayes Classifier, and test its performance in the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

Homework 2 was completed on November 11.

I submitted [a lab report](https://github.com/openx2/201814806ChenXin/blob/master/Homework2/lab%20report.pdf) with more details.

## Homework 3:
Use Tweets dataset to test performance of [those clustering methods mentioned by sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#overview-of-clustering-methods),
apply [NMI(Normalized Mutual Information)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score.html) to their results.

Homework 3 was completed on December 21.

I submitted [a lab report](https://github.com/openx2/201814806ChenXin/blob/master/Homework3/lab%20report.pdf) with more details.

## Total experiment report
I submitted [a concatenated experiment report](https://github.com/openx2/201814806ChenXin/blob/master/concatenated%20experiment%20report.pdf) as the final homework.
